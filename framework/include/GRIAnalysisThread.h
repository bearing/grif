/*
 * The GRIAnalysisThread class is an abstract class that must be inherited by
 * any class that represents a particular data acquisition device (Analysis).
 * It contains purely virtual methods that must be implemented, and are
 * guaranteed to be called in a particular order.  These methods must handle
 * the initialization, data acquisition and shutdown procedures for a Analysis.
 * Within these methods, please use the public methods available in
 * GRIProcessThread to write to the memory manager and read from the memory
 * manager.  Methods in GRIProcessThread are also available for dynamically
 * changing parameters in any inheriting class.
 *   \see GRIProcessThread()

 * The app engineer must create a class inheriting GRIAnalysisThread that

 * implementation, the app engineer will not implement the while loop
 * controlling data collection (see run() method).

 class MyAnalysis : public GRIAnalysisThread {
 public:
 myAnalysis() { do stuff }
 ~myAnalysis() { do stuff }

 }

 virtual int startDataAcquisition() {
 //Do routines that must run immediately
 //before data collection.
 }

 virtual int acquireData() {
 //Do routine that actually collects data
 //with the expectation that acquireData()
 //will be run in a loop (as shown in run()).
 //Use the methods inherited from GRIProcessThread
 //to write data to memory through the regulator.
 }

 virtual int stopDataAcquisition() {
 //Do routines that must run immediately
 //after data collection.
 }

 virtual int terminationRoutines() {
 //Do things that turn off DAQ
 }
