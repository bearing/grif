/// A GRIAnalysisThread class
/// The GRIAnalysisThread class is an abstract class that must be inherited by
/// any class that represents a particular data acquisition device (Analysis).
/// It contains purely virtual methods that must be implemented, and are
/// guaranteed to be called in a particular order.  These methods must handle
/// the initialization, data acquisition and shutdown procedures for a Analysis.
/// Within these methods, please use the public methods available in
/// GRIProcessThread to write to the memory manager and read from the memory
/// manager.  Methods in GRIProcessThread are also available for dynamically
/// changing parameters in any inheriting class.
///
/// see GRIProcessThread()
///
/// The app engineer must create a class inheriting GRIAnalysisThread that
/// implements the following methods.  Unlike in our SIS Analysis
/// implementation, the app engineer will not implement the while loop
/// controlling data collection (see run() method).
///
/// This class might look something like this:
///
/// class MyAnalysis : public GRIAnalysisThread {
///  public:
///   MyAnalysis();
///   ~MyAnalysis();
///
///   virtual int StartDataAcquisition() {
///     // Do routines that must run immediately
///     // before data collection.
///   }
///
///   virtual int AcquireData() {
///     // Do routine that actually collects data
///     // with the expectation that acquireData()
///     // will be run in a loop (as shown in run()).
///     // Use the methods inherited from GRIProcessThread
///     // to write data to memory through the regulator.
///   }
///
///   virtual int StopDataAcquisition() {
///     // Do routines that must run immediately
///     // after data collection.
///   }
///
///   virtual int TerminationRoutines() {
///     // Do things that turn off DAQ
///   }
