* and shutdown procedures for a DAQ.  Within these methods, please use the public
* methods available in GRIProcessThread to write to the memory manager and read from
* the memory manager.  Methods in GRIProcessThread are also available for dynamically

/*
The app engineer must create a class inheriting GRIDAQThread that implements
the following methods.  Unlike in our SIS DAQ implementation, the app engineer
will not implement the while loop controlling data collection (see run() method).

This class might look something like this:

class MyDAQ : public GRIDAQThread
{
public:
myDAQ() {do stuff}
~myDAQ() {do stuff}
virtual int connectToDAQ(){
//Talk to hardware
}

virtual int initalize(){
//Initialize DAQ hardware
}

virtual int loadConfiguration(){
//Configure DAQ hardware or something
}

virtual int startDataAcquisition(){
//Do routines that must run immediately
//before data collection.
}

virtual int acquireData(){
//Do routine that actually collects data
//with the expectation that acquireData()
//will be run in a loop (as shown in run()).
//Use the methods inherited from GRIProcessThread
//to write data to memory through the regulator.

}

virtual int stopDataAcquisition(){
//Do routines that must run immediately
//after data collection.
}

virtual int terminationRoutines(){
//Do things that turn off DAQ
}

//getParam and setParam for runtime getting and setting of parameters
//in classes inheriting GRIDAQThread should use the getParam and setParam
//functions inherited from GRIProcessThread
}


Setting up and running this class would look something like this.

//In loader:
MyDAQ * mydaq = new myDAQ();
//initialize
mydaq->init(QObject* obj, ProcessDetails* proc_detail, GRIRegulator *regulator);
//add a bunch of parameters so we can do gets and sets later
mydaq->addParam(QString Key, T& value);
mydaq->addParam(QString Key, T& value);
mydaq->addParam(QString Key, T& value);  //These will be user defined
mydaq->addParam(QString Key, T& value);
mydaq->addParam(QString Key, T& value);
mydaq->addParam(QString Key, T& value);


//Something will later start the daq thread, resulting in:
mydaq->run(); //which calls the user defined methods in a well-defined order.
