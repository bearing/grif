//! A memory management class
/*!
*
* The memoryManager class is meant to be used as a library object. That is to say that all other thread objects
* will be using the memoryManager class's functions in order to access memory buffers. At the start of the data
* aquisition process, exactly one memoryManager class should be created and accessed by all other threads.
*
* the purpose of the memoryManager are as follows:
* 1. to create and manage a memory space for reading and writing buffers.
* 2. to synchronize read and writes between different threads to buffers
* 3. to prevent overflow of buffers and the virtual memory address space
* 4. to act as an abstraction layer to the software's memory
*
* Elements in the memoryManager should in most cases not be directly accessed. All internal variables will be locked
* as private and can only be accessed through memory and thread safe functions. In cases where data needs to be returned,
* only a copy of the data will be handed off rather than the pointer or original data for the sake of memory security.
