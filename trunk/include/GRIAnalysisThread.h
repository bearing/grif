//! A GRIAnalysisThread class

*
* The GRIAnalysisThread class is an abstract class that must be inherited by any class
* that represents a particular data acquisition device (Analysis).  It contains purely
* virtual methods that must be implemented, and are guaranteed to be called in a
* particular order.  These methods must handle the initialization, data acquisition
* and shutdown procedures for a Analysis.  Within these methods, please use the public
* methods available in GRIProcessThread to write to the memory manager and read from
* the memory manager.  Methods in GRIProcessThread are also available for dynamically
* changing parameters in any inheriting class.

/*
The app engineer must create a class inheriting GRIAnalysisThread that implements
the following methods.  Unlike in our SIS Analysis implementation, the app engineer
will not implement the while loop controlling data collection (see run() method).

This class might look something like this:

class MyAnalysis : public GRIAnalysisThread
{
public:
myAnalysis() {do stuff}
~myAnalysis() {do stuff}

//Talk to hardware
}


virtual int startDataAcquisition(){
//Do routines that must run immediately
//before data collection.
}

virtual int acquireData(){
//Do routine that actually collects data
//with the expectation that acquireData()
//will be run in a loop (as shown in run()).
//Use the methods inherited from GRIProcessThread
//to write data to memory through the regulator.

}

virtual int stopDataAcquisition(){
//Do routines that must run immediately
//after data collection.
}

virtual int terminationRoutines(){
//Do things that turn off DAQ
}

//getParam and setParam for runtime getting and setting of parameters
//in classes inheriting GRIDAQThread should use the getParam and setParam
//functions inherited from GRIProcessThread
}


Setting up and running this class would look something like this.

//In loader:
MyDAQ * mydaq = new myDAQ();
//initialize
mydaq->init(QObject* obj, ProcessDetails* proc_detail, GRIRegulator *regulator);
//add a bunch of parameters so we can do gets and sets later
mydaq->addParam(QString Key, T& value);
mydaq->addParam(QString Key, T& value);
mydaq->addParam(QString Key, T& value);  //These will be user defined
mydaq->addParam(QString Key, T& value);
mydaq->addParam(QString Key, T& value);
mydaq->addParam(QString Key, T& value);


//Something will later start the daq thread, resulting in:
mydaq->run(); //which calls the user defined methods in a well-defined order.

*/

/*!

* starts.  It is called immediately after loadConfiguration().  It is not called for
* each startCollection().

* code of your choosing upon failure.  The error will be reported using the
* errorHandling() method.

* method is optional.
