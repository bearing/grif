# usage: perl GCG_data.pl /path/to/xml/files /path/to/auxiliary/file
# This code is for generating the definitions of data types specified by
# the user.  The GRI class GRIDataDefines.h will include the auxiliary file.
#
# The generated code goes into the file located at /path/to/auxiliary/file,
# which should be included by GRIDataDefines.h
#
# This code generation currently supports the definition of C-style structs.
# The user must provide a name for the struct.  The user can also define an
# arbitrary number of variables (by providing the type and name) to belong
# to the struct
#
# An example of the XML style is:
#
# <datat>
#   <dataname dname = "peak" />
#      <var>
#          <vtype type = "double" vname = "value" />
#          <vtype type = "double" vname = "sigma" />
#          <vtype type = "double" vname = "rate" />
#          <vtype type = "int" vname = "chan" />
#      </var>
# </datat>
#
# This will be translated to:
#
# struct peak{
#      double value;
#      double sigma;
#      double rate;
#      int chan;
# };
#
#  All of the <datat> objects in the XML file should be encapsulated by
#  the <DataDefines> tag.
